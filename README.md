## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
#### The app is meant to help business owners and warehouses view and manage their inventory.
## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
#### A login screen was needed to identify users. A screen that shows a table of all inventory was necessary, along with one to edit or add items. The UI was designed to be easy to use and visually pleasing, as ugly and confusing apps are going to end up being deleted.
## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
#### I mapped out what features were needed using psuedocode and by sketching out a UI design. Both are integral to designing apps in a clear and efficient way, and should be used where applicable in any project.
## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
#### Most of my testing was done using the Android simulator. I spent a large amount of time fiddling with the app to look for bugs and other issues.
## Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
#### The planning stages were the hardest for me, as I struggle to organize my thoughts and ideas into words or images. It took me quite a bit of work to make a design that matched what I was thinking.
## In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
#### I think the UI design is where I did my best. Growing up in an artistic household made the construction of a simple and nice looking interface far easier than the coding itself.
